<h1>Design Justifications</h1>
<h3>Design elements with justification</h3>
<br />
<p style="font-size: 25px">A flow diagram for the website describing the navigation and structure of content
</p>

    <p>

Home Page: There are two ways to access the home page in our website. In the navigation bar, on the top left corner, there is an icon of our logo, which when clicked on takes you to the home page. We wanted to include our logo because it is an essential part of our brand’s image and creates a stronger connection with the user. Another way of accessing the home page is through the “Home Page” button next to the logo. When hovering over the different pages on the navigation bar, their color changes from red to white. We did this in order to make it easier for the user to know what he/she is clicking on.
Our home page includes a carousel that displays a picture of our logo and two other promotional edits that were modified to fit this feature better. This page also includes three columns that give more information about our brand vision, message and values as well as our unique value proposition. We provide the user with important information about Groovy before he continues to the shopping portion of the website.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Products: Our next page on the navigation bar is “Products”. Below the navigation bar, there is a banner with our logo. This is available on every page except the Home Page. Below the banner, the list of our products starts. There is a name, a picture of the product and a short text that provides the user with more information about the product. There is also an “add to cart” button that when clicked, takes you straight to the Checkout Form.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p> 
        Contacts: Our next page is “Contacts”. There is a short text that encourages the user to check out our other social media. There are three buttons that take you straight to our brand’s Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. Next to them, there is another picture from our promotional activity that also encourages the user to further look into our brand.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Design Justification: This is the next page in our navigation bar that explains our website decisions.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>


Checkout: The last page on the navigation bar is a basket icon that stands for the check out. It takes you to the checkout form that includes a short message for our clients. It includes a cart that shows the price of the item added, a promo code area and total price. There is also a billing address form that the user has to fill out with their information that includes names, e-mail and address. Below that there is a payment form that asks for payment method and card information. The last button is “continue to checkout”.
    </p>

    </p>

    <img src="Images/colors.png" />

    <br />
    <p>

The colors used for the website are #FFF88D, #9D0E02, #FFFFF, #E68888 and #D9A859. These colors perfectly represent our brand and what we stand for. For the text in our website we used a soft grey shade in order to provide more contrast and make the website more sleek and clean. Our color palette is soft, muted and calming and it is not hard on the eyes.
</p>
<br />
<p style="font-size: 25px">
    Choice of fonts from Google Fonts
</p>

<br />
<p>The font we chose for our navigation bar and footer is BANGERS. It is modern and bold but also easy to read. The font we used for our headings is LUCKIEST GUY. It is interesting and fun to look at but still easy to read, which was important for us. The last font for the body of the text is IBM PLEX SERIF. It is easy to read and simple but not too boring and ordinary.

<h2> User Website Testing Outcome</h2>

<br />
	<p style="font-size: 25px">
    <strong> Case 1 - Hristina,21 </strong> </p>
    <br />
	<p  Style="font-size: 25px">
		Scenario 1: Understand who we are. 
	</p>
	<p> Describe steps: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>She clicks on the ‘Home Page’</li>
	<li>She sees the carrousel</li>
	<li>She scrolls down to the ‘About Us’ part</li>
	<li>She finds our Vision, Message and Values</li>
	<li>She scrolls to the bottom of the page and finds our Unique Value Proposition  </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p Style="font-size: 25px"> 
		Reflection</p>
	<p>All the information is on the same page in order to make it easier for users to get to know us.
She thinks that it was easy to find the information about our brand and was happy that she didn’t have to look all around our site to find the Message we want to convey. Users could get to know the brand with the help of just a scroll. She thinks that it is a little hard to understand what we offer just from the Home Page as it is only mentioned once in the Unique Values.
 </p>

 <br />

	<p Style="font-size: 25px"> Scenario 2: Find out what we offer.</p>
	<p> Describe steps: </p>
	<ul> 
	<li>She clicks on ‘Products’</li>
	<li>She scrolls through the page </li>
	<li>She sees all the products we have accompanied by a description </li>
	<li>She clicks on ‘Add to cart’ under her chosen item </li>
	<li>She sees the ‘Checkout’ page but it is still not activated  </li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 25px"> 
		Reflection </p>
	<p> Users can easily find our products in the website and they can reach the ‘Checkout’ easily, but the page is still not activated as we do not have actual products to sell and we do not want to confuse or mislead our customers to share personal information.
She liked that it takes just one click to reach our ‘Products’ page and thinks that the description under the products is intriguing. She likes how the ‘Checkout’ page looks and would definitely use it if it’s activated soon. She appreciates that its not possible to write in the blank spaces for personal information as the form is not active still and she could not mistakenly type any information.
</p>
<br />

<p style="font-size: 25px"> 
	Scenario 3: Contact our team.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 25px">Describe steps:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li>She clicks on ‘Contacts’</li>
		<li>A page with links to our social media opens</li>
		<li>She chooses which social media she wants to contact us on </li>
		<li>She clicks on the button ‘Instagram’ to visit out Insta page </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="font-size: 25px"> Reflection </p>
	<p>Users can easily find our ‘Contacts’ page. With just a click they can see our social media.
She admitted that she was looking for a form to fill in the website in order to contact us but turned out to be happy to check our social media and contact us there as we respond faster there. The social media is a faster way for the user to have a chat with us and seek more information about a product.

    <strong> Case 2 - Nikolay,21 </strong> </p>

    <br />

	<p  Style="font-size: 25px">
		Scenario 1: Understand who we are. 
	</p>
	<p> Describe steps: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>He clicks on the ‘Groovy’ logo </li>
		<li>The home page opens </li>
		<li>He clicks through the carrousel  </li>
		<li>He scrolls down and finds our Vision, Message and Values </li>
		<li>He scrolls further and sees our Unique Value Proposition</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 25px"> Reflection </p>
	<p>He found it easy to navigate through the site and easy to find the Vision of our brand as that is what he was searching for. He thinks its nice that we have that information together with the Message and the Values because that way it is easy for the user to get to know the brand faster and immediately know if it aligns with their beliefs. He did not understand what the brand is about from the first read. </p>
	
	<br />

	<p Style="font-size: 25px"> Scenario 2: Find out what we offer.</p>
	<p> Describe steps: </p>
	<ul> 
	<li>He clicks on ‘Products’ to see what the brand is about </li>
	<li>He scrolls down to the products that are accompanied with a description each </li>
		<li>He does not choose an item </li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 25px"> Reflection </p>
	<p> He realised the brand offers makeup. He found it helpful that the pictures are big and the descriptions are readable. 
The user easily navigated through our website and found the products we offer.
</p>

<br />

	<p style="font-size: 25px"> 
	Scenario 3: Contact our team.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 25px">Describe steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He clicks on ‘Contacts’ to seek more information</li>
		<li>He scrolls down and finds the buttons with social media he can choose from</li>
		<li>He clicks on the ‘Facebook’ button </li>
        <li>Our Facebook page opens and he can text us </li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-size: 25px"> Reflection </p>
	<p>Users can choose where they want to contact us according to the social media they prefer.
He thinks it is nice that he can contact us on Facebook instead of through a form in the website because he does not open his email frequently and possibly will not see our response on time. He appreciated that he can choose from more than on social media platform.
