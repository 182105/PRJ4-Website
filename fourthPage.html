<h3>Design elements with justification</h3>

<p style="font-size: 25px">A flow diagram for the website describing the navigation and structure of content
</p>

    <p>

Home Page: There are two ways to access the home page in our website. In the navigation bar, on the top left corner, there is an icon of our logo, which when clicked on takes you to the home page. We wanted to include our logo because it is an essential part of our brand’s image and creates a stronger connection with the user. Another way of accessing the home page is through the “Home Page” button next to the logo. When hovering over the different pages on the navigation bar, their color changes from red to white. We did this in order to make it easier for the user to know what he/she is clicking on.
Our home page includes a carousel that displays a picture of our logo and two other promotional edits that were modified to fit this feature better. This page also includes three columns that give more information about our brand vision, message and values as well as our unique value proposition. We provide the user with important information about Groovy before he continues to the shopping portion of the website.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Products: Our next page on the navigation bar is “Products”. Below the navigation bar, there is a banner with our logo. This is available on every page except the Home Page. Below the banner, the list of our products starts. There is a name, a picture of the product and a short text that provides the user with more information about the product. There is also an “add to cart” button that when clicked, takes you straight to the Checkout Form.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p> 
        Contacts: Our next page is “Contacts”. There is a short text that encourages the user to check out our other social media. There are three buttons that take you straight to our brand’s Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. Next to them, there is another picture from our promotional activity that also encourages the user to further look into our brand.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Design Justification: This is the next page in our navigation bar that explains our website decisions.

    </p>

    <br />

    <p>


Checkout: The last page on the navigation bar is a basket icon that stands for the check out. It takes you to the checkout form that includes a short message for our clients. It includes a cart that shows the price of the item added, a promo code area and total price. There is also a billing address form that the user has to fill out with their information that includes names, e-mail and address. Below that there is a payment form that asks for payment method and card information. The last button is “continue to checkout”.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>

The colors used for the website are #FFF88D, #9D0E02, #FFFFF, #E68888 and #D9A859. These colors perfectly represent our brand and what we stand for. For the text in our website we used a soft grey shade in order to provide more contrast and make the website more sleek and clean. Our color palette is soft, muted and calming and it is not hard on the eyes.

    Choice of fonts from Google Fonts
</p>

<br />
<p>The font we chose for our navigation bar and footer is BANGERS. It is modern and bold but also easy to read. The font we used for our headings is LUCKIEST GUY. It is interesting and fun to look at but still easy to read, which was important for us. The last font for the body of the text is IBM PLEX SERIF. It is easy to read and simple but not too boring and ordinary.
